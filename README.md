# Image Builder MCP

This repo is in a DRAFT and playground state!

An MCP server to interact with [hosted image builder](https://osbuild.org/docs/hosted/architecture/)

⚠️ The current development is **moved here**: https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-mcp

This should be a collection of MCP servers related to Red Hat Insights.
Maybe in the future the code will be split again in separate repositories.  
For now to increase reuse we'll work in [one repository](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-mcp).
